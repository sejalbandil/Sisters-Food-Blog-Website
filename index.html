    <h3>Mizu's </h3>
    <p>Mizu's is a sushi restaurant. It is located in the Mountain View Safeway complex. I love going to this restaurant because the service is amazing. I get a table within 5 minutes. The waiters are really friendly. I love this restaurant as you get miso soup on the house. My favorite roll is spicy crunchy. I would give this restaurant 5 stars.</p>
    <h3>Opa's:</h3>
    <p>Opa's is a Greek restaurant. It is in Los Altos Downtown. I usually go there with my family on Friday nights! The service is really good, however, on Friday the wait can take a while. The waiters are very nice and our food does not take that long to come. I really enjoy the meatballs with goat cheese. I would give this restaurant 5 stars. If you have this restaurant in your area I recommend checking it out.</p>
